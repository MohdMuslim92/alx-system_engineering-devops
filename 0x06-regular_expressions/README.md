**Regular Expression Project
This project involves writing Ruby scripts that use regular expressions to match specific patterns in given input strings. The regular expressions will be built for the Oniguruma library, which is used by Ruby by default. Each task requires creating a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.

0. Simply Matching School
Requirements:

The regular expression must match "School".
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
1. Repetition Token #0
Requirements:

Find the regular expression that will match certain cases.
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
2. Repetition Token #1
Requirements:

Find the regular expression that will match certain cases.
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
3. Repetition Token #2
Requirements:

Find the regular expression that will match certain cases.
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
4. Repetition Token #3
Requirements:

Find the regular expression that will match certain cases.
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
The regex should not contain square brackets.
5. Not Quite HBTN Yet
Requirements:

The regular expression must exactly match a string that starts with 'h', ends with 'n', and can have any single character in between.
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
6. Call Me Maybe
Requirement:

The regular expression must match a 10-digit phone number.
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
7. OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?
Requirement:

The regular expression must only match capital letters.
File Structure
How to Run
Clone the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/MohdMuslim92/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
Navigate to the project folder: cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x06-regular_expressions
To execute a script, use the Ruby interpreter followed by the script name and the input argument. For example, to run the first task: ruby 0-simply_match_school.rb "School"
Note
Make sure to test each script with different input arguments to ensure it matches the required patterns using the provided regular expressions.

Feel free to modify and improve the scripts based on your understanding of regular expressions and Ruby
