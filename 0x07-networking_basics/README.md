**Networking Basics
This project covers various concepts and topics related to networking basics. It includes questions and tasks that will test your understanding of the OSI model, different types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, and UDP/TCP protocols. You will also work with ports and ICMP using Bash scripting.

Tasks
0. OSI model
Questions:
What is the OSI model?
Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology
How is the OSI model organized?
Alphabetically
From the lowest to the highest level
Randomly
1. Types of network
Questions:
What type of network is a computer in local connected to?
Internet
WAN
LAN
What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?
Internet
WAN
LAN
What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?
Internet
WAN
LAN
2. MAC and IP address
Questions:
What is a MAC address?
The name of a network interface
The unique identifier of a network interface
A network interface
What is an IP address?
Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
The unique identifier of a network interface
Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks
3. UDP and TCP
Questions:
Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might lose data along the process
Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might lose data along the process
Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
Have you received boxes x, y, z?
May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?
4. TCP and UDP ports
Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:
Only shows listening sockets
Shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
5. Is the host on the network
Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
Usage
Clone the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
Navigate to the project folder: cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x07-networking_basics
Execute the scripts individually using Bash: bash script_name
Make sure to provide any requiredarguments as specified in the task descriptions.
