**0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

This project consists of several bash scripts that demonstrate the usage of loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting. Each script performs specific tasks and showcases different concepts. Below is a description of each script and its functionality.

Scripts
0. Create a SSH RSA key pair
This script generates an SSH RSA key pair using the ssh-keygen command.

1. Display "Best School" 10 times
This script uses a loop to display the phrase "Best School" ten times in the console.

2. Display "Best School" 10 times
Similar to the previous script, this script also displays the phrase "Best School" ten times.

3. Display "Best School" 10 times with a variation
This script displays "Best School" ten times using a loop. However, during the ninth iteration, it displays "Best School" and then "Hi" on a new line.

4. Loop with conditional statements
This script loops from 1 to 10 and displays different messages based on the iteration number. It displays "bad luck" for the fourth iteration, "good luck" for the eighth iteration, and "Best School" for the other iterations.

5. Loop with conditional statements and custom messages
Similar to the previous script, this script displays numbers from 1 to 20. However, during the fourth, ninth, and seventeenth iterations, it displays specific messages after the number.

6. Display time for 12 hours and 59 minutes
This script displays the time in a 12-hour format. It loops through hours from 0 to 12 and minutes from 1 to 59, displaying each combination.

7. List files in the current directory
This script lists the contents of the current directory in a list format. It only displays the part of the name after the first dash.

8. Information about the "school" file
This script checks if a file named "school" exists and provides information about it. It checks if the file exists and if it is empty or a regular file, printing the corresponding messages.

9. FizzBuzz game
This script displays numbers from 1 to 100. It prints "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, "Fizz" if divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, and the number itself otherwise.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the script files individually.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
Run each script individually using the Bash interpreter. For example: ./script_name.sh
