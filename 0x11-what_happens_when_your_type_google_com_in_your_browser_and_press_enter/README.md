**0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

Background Context

Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means having a holistic understanding of how software systems work, from the frontend to the backend. This project aims to explore the infrastructure side of the web stack, delving into network architecture, server management, and security considerations. By explaining what happens when a user types a URL into their browser and presses Enter, we gain valuable insights into the workings of the internet.

Introduction

We will be on the journey of a user's request when they type "https://www.google.com" into their browser and hit Enter.

Blog Post Content

In this blog post, we will cover the following components of the web stack:

    DNS Request: The initiation point where the browser translates a human-readable domain (e.g., "google.com") into an IP address.
    TCP/IP: The protocol used for reliable data transmission over the internet.
    Firewall: The security mechanism that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
    HTTPS/SSL: The encryption of data for secure communication between the browser and the web server.
    Load-Balancer: The system responsible for distributing incoming user requests across multiple servers.
    Web Server: The component that handles HTTP requests, fetches web pages, and generates dynamic content.
    Application Server: Where dynamic content is processed, user requests are handled, and data interactions with the database occur.
    Database: The repository for storing and retrieving data.
